String::Random is used to generate random strings.  It was written to
make generating random passwords and such a little easier.  See the
documentation in pod format in the module for more information.

String::Random now requires Module::Build to build and install.
To install the module, simply do the following:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

This module requires Perl5.  Any version newer than 5.6.0 should work,
but it has only been tested on recent versions.  Version 0.20 and
earlier of this module should work with any Perl5 release.  You can
find older releases on backpan:

                ******  PLEASE NOTE  ******

This module is still somewhat experimental.  I'm trying to determine
exactly what the feature set of the module should be.  Please send
suggestions, bug reports, comments, etc. to the author, Steven
Pritchard <steve@silug.org>.
